Changelog v0.1b
===================

 * Writing to 3DS cards works now
 * Improved save size detection for 3DS cards
 * Fixed progress bar on Win32
 * Added some error detection

Known Issues
===================

 * Card detection for DS cards that don't have their size reported (EEPROM) isn't implemented
 * Certain games have a specific flag set in official software, not implemented yet

Notes
===================

The official app writes 3DS cards in full and then writes the first 16kB *again*. 005tools
mimics this but I haven't bothered to change how the progress bar works, so don't be surprised
when the progress bar resets after writing all the data.

Also, when writing 3DS/very large cards, you'll notice the progress bar freeze after the first
128kB is written.  The official software does the same thing, and writing resumes ~7 seconds
later.  I have no idea why it does this, but it does.

Tests
===================
I'm just one man, and I only have a handful of games, but here are the ones I've tested.
Testing using a cycle of READ, ERASE, PLAY, WRITE, READ, DIFF, PLAY, where DIFF is a simple
diff -qs on the uploaded data and the read data.  

As a general rule, there aren't any problems reading, so if you come across a game that won't
write then you can just use the official software in Windows to write your backup.  If you
do come across a game that won't work with any function of this application, please let me
know and I may be able to fix it.

¹ Save size not detected because the R4i firmware doesn't detect it, this appears to be due to the
  save type (EEPROM vs Flash)
² I suspect that, but haven't tested, the official software will not write to this card either.
